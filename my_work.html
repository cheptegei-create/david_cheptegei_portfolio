              Startup companies and SMEs are struggling in todays global market
              due to lack of proper resources to compete with already
              established companies. This website is created to help SMEs and
              startup companies have a competitive advantage in the global
              market. Hence, it will give SMEs and startup companies the right
              tools that are being utilized by established companies, while
              allowing them to focus on delivery to customers. I have realized
              that online presence is an essential tool for any company to
              succeed in today's global market.

              Employers in the tech industry prefer candidates with well
              prepared portfolios. A portfolio assists a lot during interviews
              by avoiding to explain what you can do. The main reason for
              building this website is to have a platform where I can showcase
              my work to employers. The website enables me to present my work to
              a potential employer as proof of what I can do. I learned that
              with CSS one can build a selling and eye appealing portfolio.

              Sometimes we can eaisly end up repeating one password several
              times exposing our work to the risk of hacking. This project is to
              make the work of a developer or any user with lots of sensitive
              information to easily generate complex password to protect their
              work. It prevents hacking because of using simple passwords that
              can be easily guessed, and it also prevents repetitive passwords.
              I learned that one can create very useful applications and
              websites with JavaScript.

              Sometime it's difficult to keep track of what you've done in your
              day to day activities and at the end of the day you might feel as
              if time flew and you've not done much. The work day scheduler
              enables the user to keep track of their daily activities and plan
              their time accordingly. The work scheduler is an important
              time-management tool that we all need if one values their time.
              You can do alot than you think in an hour's time.
